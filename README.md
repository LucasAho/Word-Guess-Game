Project Name: 
    Video Game Themed Hangman Game
Description: 
    This repo makes use of JS, CSS, and HTML to create a hangman style game in which a player can use keyboard inputs to guess a word taken from an array of video game titles. 
    The majority of the magic happens in the game.js file, which will fill out information on the document as is relavent. The game.js file will only begin the game when the player enters any keyboard
    input and will only accept lowercase letters as guesses towards the solution. It tracks the player's consecutive wins, the remaining spaces to be filled, the remaining number of lives, and the letters that the
    player has incorrectly guessed.
Project Status: 
    While this project's logic is fully functionally, it's CSS could use more work and will see more attention as I have time.
Installation:
    This file should run out of the browser just fine, but if you'd like your own copy, just be sure to copy the repo's file paths, keeping the assets folder intact and properly referenced.
Acknowledgement:
    Thank you Jeff for giving me an awesome README guide and giving me the resources I needed to create this.
